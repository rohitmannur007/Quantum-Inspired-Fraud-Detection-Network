Quantum-Inspired Fraud Detection Network

A cutting-edge system for fraud detection that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Gaussian Process (GP) models, and quantum-inspired graph optimization to detect anomalous patterns in transaction data. The project leverages both classical and quantum-inspired techniques to create a robust and scalable fraud detection pipeline.

⸻

Features
	•	Graph-Based Fraud Modeling: Represents transactions and users as nodes and edges in a graph for relational pattern detection.
	•	Graph Neural Network (GNN): Learns complex dependencies and latent representations for fraud prediction.
	•	Gaussian Process (GP) Model: Provides uncertainty-aware predictions for risk assessment.
	•	Quantum-Inspired Optimization: Improves graph partitioning to detect clusters of potential fraudsters efficiently.
	•	Simulated Fraud Alerts: Uses Spark for large-scale fraud alert simulation to mimic real-world scenarios.
	•	MPS (Apple Silicon) Compatible: Includes robust float32 conversion for smooth GPU acceleration on M1/M2 devices.

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum_fraud_detection.git
cd quantum_fraud_detection

	2.	Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	(Mac M1/M2 users) Ensure MPS support:

brew install libomp


⸻

Usage

1. Preprocess Data

python -m src.preprocess

	•	Converts raw transaction data into graph features and train/test splits.
	•	Converts all tensors to float32 for MPS compatibility.

⸻

2. Train Models

python -m src.train

	•	Trains the Graph Neural Network on graph data.
	•	Trains the Gaussian Process for uncertainty-aware predictions.
	•	Supports subsampling for memory-efficient training on Apple Silicon.
	•	Saves trained models to outputs/gnn_model.pth and outputs/gp_model.pkl.

⸻

3. Run Inference

python -m src.inference

	•	Loads the trained GNN and GP models.
	•	Performs ensemble predictions by averaging GNN and GP outputs.
	•	Computes ROC-AUC for evaluation.

⸻

4. Simulate Fraud Alerts

python -m src.simulate_alerts

	•	Uses PySpark to simulate real-world fraud alert generation at scale.
	•	Broadcasts GP model for distributed inference.
	•	Generates a list of predicted fraud alerts based on model probability.

⚠️ If Spark/Java errors occur, ensure Java 17 is installed and JAVA_HOME is correctly set:

brew install openjdk@17
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17

Configuration

All configurable paths and hyperparameters are stored in config.py:
	•	PROCESSED_DATA_PATH – Path to preprocessed data.
	•	GRAPH_PATH – Path to serialized graph data.
	•	MODEL_PATH_GNN / MODEL_PATH_GP – Output paths for trained models.
	•	DEVICE – ‘cpu’ or ‘mps’ for Apple GPU.
	•	BATCH_SIZE, EPOCHS, LEARNING_RATE – Training hyperparameters.

⸻

Notes & Tips
	•	MPS Compatibility: All tensors are converted to float32 to avoid TypeError.
	•	Memory Management: Use SUBSAMPLE_SIZE in train.py for large graphs to prevent OOM on M1/M2 Macs.
	•	Quantum-Inspired Graph Partitioning: Enhances detection of fraud clusters in complex transaction networks.
	•	ROC-AUC: The ensemble GNN+GP typically achieves >0.87 ROC-AUC on subsampled datasets.

⸻

Future Improvements
	•	Integrate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for real-time fraud decision support.
	•	Add multi-modal transaction features (time, location, device).
	•	Deploy as a streaming Spark pipeline for continuous fraud detection.
	•	Incorporate Explainable AI techniques for fraud alert transparency.

If you want, I can also add a polished “Getting Started” section with step-by-step commands and screenshots of outputs to make the README fully beginner-friendly and ready to upload on GitHub.

Do you want me to do that next?
