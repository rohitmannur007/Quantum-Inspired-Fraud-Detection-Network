Quantum-Inspired Fraud Detection Network 🚀

A hybrid, multi-stage AI system for detecting fraudulent transactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling, and quantum-inspired graph optimization. Optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) using MPS backend, capable of scaling to large datasets with Apache Spark.

⸻

🔹 Project Overview

Fraud detection in financial systems requires both pattern recognition and risk-aware prediction. This project integrates:
	1.	Graph Representation – models entities (cardholders/accounts) as nodes, transactions as edges.
	2.	Quantum-Inspired Graph Optimization – partitions the graph to highlight suspicious clusters.
	3.	Graph Neural Network (GNN) – captures structural dependencies for node-level fraud probabilities.
	4.	Gaussian Process (GP) – quantifies uncertainty and complements GNN predictions.
	5.	Ensemble & Inference – combines GNN + GP outputs for final fraud probability.
	6.	Alert Simulation – scales to large datasets using Spark, producing actionable fraud alerts.

⸻

🔹 Key Features
	•	Hybrid AI Architecture: GNN + GP ensemble
	•	Quantum-Inspired Optimization: Guides model to high-risk clusters
	•	Scalable Alerts: Uses Spark for big-data simulation
	•	Apple Silicon Optimized: Robust float64 → float32 conversion for MPS compatibility
	•	Modular Pipeline: Preprocessing → Training → Inference → Alerts

🔹 Workflow

1️⃣ Data & Graph Construction
	•	Load transactions → extract features
	•	Build graph: nodes = entities, edges = transactions
	•	Optional: synthetic graph generation for testing

graph_data = load_graph(GRAPH_PATH)
graph_data.x = graph_data.x.float()  # MPS-compatible


⸻

2️⃣ Quantum-Inspired Graph Optimization
	•	Partitions the graph into high-risk clusters
	•	Reduces graph complexity and guides GNN learning

nx_graph = to_networkx(graph_data)
partitions = quantum_inspired_optimization(nx_graph)


⸻

3️⃣ GNN Training
	•	Node-level prediction of fraud probability
	•	Batch size and node subsampling used for Apple M2 memory efficiency

model = GNNModel(in_channels=graph_data.num_features).to(DEVICE)


⸻

4️⃣ Gaussian Process (GP) Training
	•	Adds uncertainty-aware prediction
	•	Outputs probability of fraud

gp = train_gp(X_train, y_train)
pickle.dump(gp, open(MODEL_PATH_GP, "wb"))


⸻

5️⃣ Ensemble & Inference
	•	Combines GNN + GP predictions for final fraud probability
	•	Evaluated using ROC-AUC (currently ~0.88)

combined_prob = (gnn_pred + gp_prob) / 2
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, combined_prob)


⸻

6️⃣ Simulated Alerts
	•	Uses Spark to simulate large-scale fraud alerts
	•	Returns indices of transactions likely to be fraudulent

alerts = [i for i, p in enumerate(probs) if p > 0.5]
print(f"Simulated fraud alerts: {alerts[:10]}... (total {len(alerts)})")


⸻

🔹 Results
	•	ROC-AUC: 0.8785 (on subsampled test set)
	•	Simulated Alerts Example: [0, 3, 4, 8, 12, 14, 20, 56, 60, 64]

Can scale to full dataset using Spark with minimal memory overhead.

⸻

🔹 Usage
	1.	Preprocess Data

python -m src.preprocess

	2.	Train Models

python -m src.train

	3.	Run Inference

python -m src.inference

	4.	Simulate Alerts

python -m src.simulate_alerts


⸻

🔹 Notes / Optimizations
	•	Apple Silicon (M1/M2): All float64 tensors are converted to float32 for MPS compatibility.
	•	Subsampling: Reduce SUBSAMPLE_SIZE in train.py if OOM occurs.
	•	Quantum-inspired partitions: Optional hyperparameter tuning to maximize cluster detection.
	•	Security: GNN model loading can use weights_only=True to avoid untrusted pickle execution.

🔹 Future Improvements
	•	Multi-modal features: Include geolocation, device fingerprints
	•	RAG-style anomaly reasoning for rare fraud types
	•	Integration with real-time streaming data for live alerts
	•	Expand GNN architecture (GraphSAGE, GAT) for improved embedding learning
