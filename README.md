Got it! Let’s make a proper, well-structured, and polished README for your project that is unique, clear, and professional, with correct sections and flow. I’ll remove redundancy, fix formatting, and present it in a GitHub-ready style.

Here’s the updated full README:

Quantum-Inspired Fraud Detection Network 🛡️

A next-generation AI system for detecting fraudulent transactions using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling, and Quantum-Inspired Graph Optimization. Designed to handle large-scale financial datasets and optimized for Apple Silicon (M1/M2).

⸻

Project Overview

Detecting fraud in financial transactions is challenging due to complex relationships between entities and rare event distribution. This project combines:
	•	Graph Neural Networks (GNN): Captures structural dependencies among accounts and transactions.
	•	Gaussian Process (GP): Provides uncertainty-aware predictions for risk-sensitive decision-making.
	•	Quantum-Inspired Optimization: Highlights clusters of high-risk nodes in the transaction graph.
	•	Spark-based Simulation: Efficiently scales fraud alert generation for large datasets.

The system produces a fraud probability score for each transaction and simulates actionable alerts.

⸻

Features
	•	Hybrid AI system combining GNN + GP ensemble.
	•	Quantum-inspired graph partitioning for enhanced fraud detection.
	•	Subsampling and MPS-compatible tensor conversions for Apple Silicon.
	•	End-to-end pipeline: Preprocessing → Training → Inference → Alert Simulation.
	•	Scalable alert generation using Apache Spark.

⸻

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rohitmannur007/quantum_fraud_detection.git
cd quantum_fraud_detection

	2.	Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	(Optional) Install Apache Spark for alert simulation:

brew install apache-spark
brew install openjdk@17
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17

Workflow

1️⃣ Data Loading & Graph Construction
	•	Load transaction data and features.
	•	Construct a graph: nodes = accounts, edges = transactions.
	•	Optional: subsample nodes for memory efficiency on M1/M2.

graph_data = load_graph(GRAPH_PATH)
graph_data.x = graph_data.x.float()  # MPS-compatible


⸻

2️⃣ Quantum-Inspired Graph Partitioning
	•	Partitions the graph into clusters to highlight suspicious groups.

nx_graph = to_networkx(graph_data)
partitions = quantum_inspired_optimization(nx_graph)


⸻

3️⃣ Model Training

Gaussian Process (GP)
	•	Uncertainty-aware probabilistic prediction.

gp = train_gp(X_train, y_train)
pickle.dump(gp, open(MODEL_PATH_GP, "wb"))

Graph Neural Network (GNN)
	•	Node-level fraud prediction using message passing.
	•	Subsampling is applied for large graphs to prevent memory issues.

model = GNNModel(in_channels=graph_data.num_features).to(DEVICE)


⸻

4️⃣ Inference & Ensemble
	•	Combine GNN and GP outputs for final fraud probability.

combined_prob = (gnn_pred + gp_prob) / 2
auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, combined_prob)

	•	Current ROC-AUC: ~0.8785

⸻

5️⃣ Fraud Alert Simulation
	•	Uses Spark for scalable alert generation.
	•	Returns indices of transactions likely to be fraudulent.

alerts = [i for i, p in enumerate(probs) if p > 0.5]
print(f"Simulated fraud alerts: {alerts[:10]}... (total {len(alerts)})")


⸻

Usage
	1.	Preprocess data:

python -m src.preprocess

	2.	Train models:

python -m src.train

	3.	Run inference:

python -m src.inference

	4.	Simulate alerts:

python -m src.simulate_alerts


⸻

Notes
	•	Apple Silicon M1/M2: Converts all float64 tensors to float32 for MPS backend.
	•	Memory Optimization: Subsampling reduces memory footprint for large graphs.
	•	Security: When loading GNN model, consider weights_only=True to avoid untrusted pickle execution.
	•	Quantum Optimization: Provides enhanced cluster-level insight for fraud detection.

⸻

Future Improvements
	•	Integrate multi-modal features like geolocation and device fingerprints.
	•	Real-time streaming alert system for live transaction monitoring.
	•	Experiment with advanced GNN architectures (GraphSAGE, GAT) for better embedding learning.
	•	Explore RAG-style reasoning for rare and complex fraud cases.

If you want, I can also create a polished GitHub-ready diagram showing nodes, clusters, and the full workflow. This would make your README visually attractive and highly professional.

Do you want me to create that diagram next?
